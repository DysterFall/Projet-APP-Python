My project is a user interface application designed for scientists, commercial professionals, etc., allowing them to access and manage their projects.

Additionally, the application includes a login system where administrators can log in and moderate users by:

    Adding new users
    Modifying user details
    Deleting users
    Displaying user information

All user data will be securely stored in our database for efficient management.

To run the application, start by launching the file 'mysqlite3.py' to create the necessary database. Then, you can proceed to run the main file to access the application.
